Today I focused in making a puppet in a stick, similar to how a Paper Shadow Puppet work

After watching some tutorials and using Unity 2d physics, rigidbodies, 2d Hinge joints and Kenney art assets, I ended up with a 2d ragdoll, and later a 2d puppet close enought to what i wanted

Here are a list of references that I used for this part of the project
